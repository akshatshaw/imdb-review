# imdb-review
Hello guys this is my first project on machince learning. I have taken the IMDB dataset from kaggle and trained a model on it.
Then I have used the streamlit to create web-app for my model and have deployed my model on the streamlit application via this github repository.

In the web-app if you write any review about a movie, it will predict whether the riview is positive or negative.
